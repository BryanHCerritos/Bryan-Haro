                Hi, I'm Bryan Haro. I'm currently 23 years old and I'm a student that enjoys traveling when I get the chance, especially on my last trips that I went, which are Japan and Mexico. 
                It was fun going to Japan since it was my first time experiencing a new culture besides my own, where I was meeting new people, driving my dream car, visiting local clubs, and just buying stuff. 
                When I'm not on an adventure, I enjoy hanging out with friends and making great memories. 
                I'm currently in college pursuing a degree in Computer Science while working to achieve my goals. 
                Building computers is one of my passions, whether it's for friends or as a side hustle. 
                Cars are another big interest of mine, and attending car meets in Japan was an unforgettable experience.
